This 15-puzzle game is a web application that allows users to upload an image, which will then be split into 16 smaller pieces. 

One piece will be replaced with a yellow tile, and the other 15 pieces will be placed randomly on a 4x4 grid. 

The goal of the game is to reassemble the original image by swapping the adjacent pieces with the yellow tile.

The user can click on any of the 15 tiles that are adjacent to the yellow tile, and the positions of the clicked tile and the yellow tile will be swapped. The original image with 50% transparency will be set as the background of the grid, providing a reference for the user while they attempt to solve the puzzle.

The game supports various image formats, and the uploaded image will be automatically resized to fit the 4x4 grid. Once the user has successfully reassembled the image, they can upload a new image to play again.
