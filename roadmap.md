Add a shuffle function: Implement a proper shuffling function that generates a solvable puzzle. Currently, the game may generate unsolvable puzzles.

Add a timer: Implement a timer to track the time taken to solve the puzzle, providing an additional challenge for players to complete the puzzle faster.

Add a move counter: Implement a move counter to track the number of moves made by the player. This could be used to calculate a player's score based on efficiency.

Add a victory condition: Detect when the puzzle is solved, and display a message or a popup to congratulate the player.


Improve the code architecture: Refactor the code to use classes or functions for better organization, readability, and maintainability. This could include creating a separate class for tiles or a class for the game board itself.

Responsive design: Make the game board and UI elements responsive to accommodate different screen sizes and devices.

Add a reset button: Implement a reset button that allows the player to restart the game with a new shuffled puzzle.

Add animations: Incorporate smooth animations for tile movement to enhance the gameplay experience.

Add a leaderboard: Implement a leaderboard system to store and display the best scores or fastest completion times, encouraging players to improve their performance.

Add a save feature: Implement a save feature to allow players to save their current game state and resume it later.

Offer multiple images or themes: Provide a selection of preloaded images or themes for players to choose from, in addition to the custom image upload option.

Optimize the image handling: Optimize the image handling process by limiting the size of the uploaded images, compressing them, or using canvas to crop and resize the images to the required dimensions.

Check for solvable puzzles: Implement a function to ensure that the generated puzzle is solvable. This will prevent the frustration of encountering unsolvable puzzles.

Improve the shuffling algorithm: Use a better algorithm, like the Fisher-Yates shuffle, to randomize the tiles. This will provide a more uniform distribution of randomness, leading to a better shuffling experience.

Add a move counter: Implement a move counter to track the number of moves a player makes during the game. This can add an extra layer of challenge and allow players to compete against themselves or others for a lower move count.

Timer functionality: Add a timer to track the time taken to solve the puzzle. This can encourage players to improve their speed and create a sense of urgency.

Save and load functionality: Implement a save and load feature so that players can save their progress and resume the game later.
Different difficulty levels: Add different difficulty levels by varying the size of the puzzle (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, 5x5) or by changing the number of moves required to solve the puzzle.

Visual and sound effects: Enhance the game experience by adding visual and sound effects, such as animations for tile movements or sounds when tiles are clicked or swapped.

Leaderboard or personal bests: Create a leaderboard or personal bests system to track high scores, fastest times, or the least number of moves taken to solve the puzzle.
